[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mps [22m[[4moptions[24m]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mps [22mdisplays information about a selection of the active processes.  If you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed information, use [1mtop [22minstead.

       This version of [1mps [22maccepts several kinds of options:

       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

       Options  of  different  types  may  be freely mixed, but conflicts can appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are functionally identical, due to the many standards and [1mps[0m
       implementations that this [1mps [22mis compatible with.

       Note that [1mps -aux [22mis distinct from [1mps aux[22m.  The POSIX and UNIX standards require that [1mps -aux [22mprint all processes owned by a user named [4mx[24m, as well as  printing  all  processes  that
       would  be  selected by the [1m-a [22moption.  If the user named [4mx[24m does not exist, this [1mps [22mmay interpret the command as [1mps aux [22minstead and print a warning.  This behavior is intended to aid
       in transitioning old scripts and habits.  It is fragile, subject to change, and thus should not be relied upon.

       By default, [1mps [22mselects all processes with the same effective user ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same terminal as the invoker.  It displays  the  process
       ID  (pid=PID),  the  terminal  associated  with  the  process (tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the executable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is
       unsorted by default.

       The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to the default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND) instead of the executable  name.   You  can  override
       this  with  the  [1mPS_FORMAT [22menvironment variable. The use of BSD-style options will also change the process selection to include processes on other terminals (TTYs) that are owned by
       you; alternately, this may be described as setting the selection to be the set of all processes filtered to exclude processes owned by other users  or  not  on  a  terminal.   These
       effects are not considered when options are described as being "identical" below, so [1m-M [22mwill be considered identical to [1mZ [22mand so on.

       Except  as  described  below,  process  selection  options are additive.  The default selection is discarded, and then the selected processes are added to the set of processes to be
       displayed.  A process will thus be shown if it meets any of the given selection criteria.

              setting  is  BSD-like.   The  set  of processes selected in this manner is in addition to the set of processes selected by other means.  An alternate description is that this
              option causes [1mps [22mto list all processes with a terminal (tty), or to list all processes when used together with the [1mx [22moption.

              setting is BSD-like.  The set of processes selected in this manner is in addition to the set of processes selected by other means.  An  alternate  description  is  that  this
              option causes [1mps [22mto list all processes owned by you (same EUID as [1mps[22m), or to list all processes when used together with the [1ma [22moption.

[1mPROCESS SELECTION BY LIST[0m
       These options accept a single argument in the form of a blank-separated or comma-separated list.  They can be used multiple times.  For example: [1mps -p "1 2" -p 3,4[0m

       -[4m123[24m   Identical to [1m--pid [4m[22m123[24m.

       [1m-C [4m[22mcmdlist[0m
              Select  by command name.  This selects the processes whose executable name is given in [4mcmdlist[24m.  NOTE: The command name is not the same as the command line. Previous versions
              of procps and the kernel truncated this command name to 15 characters. This limitation is no longer present in both. If you depended on matching only 15 characters,  you  may
              no longer get a match.

       [1m-G [4m[22mgrplist[0m
              Select  by  real  group ID (RGID) or name.  This selects the processes whose real group name or ID is in the [4mgrplist[24m list.  The real group ID identifies the group of the user
              who created the process, see [4mgetgid[24m(2).

       [1m-g [4m[22mgrplist[0m
              Select by session OR by effective group name.  Selection by session is specified by many standards, but selection by effective group is  the  logical  behavior  that  several
              other operating systems use.  This [1mps [22mwill select by session when the list is completely numeric (as sessions are).  Group ID numbers will work only when some group names are
              also specified.  See the [1m-s [22mand [1m--group [22moptions.

       [1m--Group [4m[22mgrplist[0m
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  Identical to [1m-G[22m.

       [1m--group [4m[22mgrplist[0m
              Select  by  effective  group  ID (EGID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective group name or ID is in [4mgrplist[24m.  The effective group ID describes the group whose
              file access permissions are used by the process (see [4mgetegid[24m(2)).  The [1m-g [22moption is often an alternative to [1m--group[22m.

       [1mp [4m[22mpidlist[0m
              Select by process ID.  Identical to [1m-p [22mand [1m--pid[22m.

       [1m-p [4m[22mpidlist[0m
              Select by PID.  This selects the processes whose process ID numbers appear in [4mpidlist[24m.  Identical to [1mp [22mand [1m--pid[22m.

       [1m--pid [4m[22mpidlist[0m
              Select by process ID.  Identical to [1m-p [22mand [1mp[22m.

       [1m--ppid [4m[22mpidlist[0m
              Select by parent process ID.  This selects the processes with a parent process ID in [4mpidlist[24m.  That is, it selects processes that are children of those listed in [4mpidlist[24m.

       [1mq [4m[22mpidlist[0m
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to [1m-q [22mand [1m--quick-pid[22m.

       [1m-q [4m[22mpidlist[0m
              Select by PID (quick mode).  This selects the processes whose process ID numbers appear in [4mpidlist[24m.  With this option [1mps [22mreads the necessary info only for the pids listed  in
              the  [4mpidlist[24m  and doesn‚Äôt apply additional filtering rules. The order of pids is unsorted and preserved. No additional selection options, sorting and forest type listings are
              allowed in this mode.  Identical to [1mq [22mand [1m--quick-pid[22m.

       [1m--quick-pid [4m[22mpidlist[0m
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to [1m-q [22mand [1mq[22m.

       [1m-s [4m[22msesslist[0m
              Select by session ID.  This selects the processes with a session ID specified in [4msesslist[24m.

       [1m--sid [4m[22msesslist[0m
              Select by session ID.  Identical to [1m-s[22m.

       [1mt [4m[22mttylist[0m
              Select by tty.  Nearly identical to [1m-t [22mand [1m--tty[22m, but can also be used with an empty [4mttylist[24m to indicate the terminal associated with [1mps[22m.  Using the [1mT  [22moption  is  considered
              cleaner than using [1mt [22mwith an empty [4mttylist[24m.

       [1m-t [4m[22mttylist[0m
              Select  by  tty.   This selects the processes associated with the terminals given in [4mttylist[24m.  Terminals (ttys, or screens for text output) can be specified in several forms:
              /dev/ttyS1, ttyS1, S1.  A plain "-" may be used to select processes not attached to any terminal.

       [1m--tty [4m[22mttylist[0m
              Select by terminal.  Identical to [1m-t [22mand [1mt[22m.

       [1mU [4m[22muserlist[0m
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective user name or ID is in [4muserlist[24m.  The effective user ID describes the user  whose  file
              access permissions are used by the process (see [4mgeteuid[24m(2)).  Identical to [1m-u [22mand [1m--user[22m.

       [1m-U [4m[22muserlist[0m
              Select  by  real  user  ID (RUID) or name.  It selects the processes whose real user name or ID is in the [4muserlist[24m list.  The real user ID identifies the user who created the
              process, see [4mgetuid[24m(2).

       [1m-u [4m[22muserlist[0m
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective user name or ID is in [4muserlist[24m.

              The effective user ID describes the user whose file access permissions are used by the process (see [4mgeteuid[24m(2)).  Identical to [1mU [22mand [1m--user[22m.

       [1m--User [4m[22muserlist[0m
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  Identical to [1m-U[22m.

       [1m--user [4m[22muserlist[0m
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  Identical to [1m-u [22mand [1mU[22m.

[1mOUTPUT FORMAT CONTROL[0m
       These options are used to choose the information displayed by [1mps[22m.  The output may differ by personality.

       [1m-c     [22mShow different scheduler information for the [1m-l [22moption.

       [1m--context[0m
              Display security context format (for SELinux).

       [1m-f     [22mDo full-format listing. This option can be combined with many other UNIX-style options to add additional columns.  It also causes the command arguments to be  printed.   When
              used with [1m-L[22m, the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP (thread ID) columns will be added.  See the [1mc [22moption, the format keyword [1margs[22m, and the format keyword [1mcomm[22m.

       [1m-F     [22mExtra full format.  See the [1m-f [22moption, which [1m-F [22mimplies.

       [1m--format [4m[22mformat[0m
              user-defined format.  Identical to [1m-o [22mand [1mo[22m.

       [1mj      [22mBSD job control format.

       [1m-j     [22mJobs format.

       [1ml      [22mDisplay BSD long format.

       [1m-l     [22mLong format.  The [1m-y [22moption is often useful with this.

       [1m-M     [22mAdd a column of security data.  Identical to [1mZ [22m(for SELinux).

       [1mO [4m[22mformat[0m
              is  preloaded  [1mo  [22m(overloaded).   The  BSD  [1mO  [22moption  can  act  like [1m-O [22m(user-defined output format with some common fields predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.
              Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some  other  way
              (e.g.  with [1m-O [22mor [1m--sort[22m).  When used as a formatting option, it is identical to [1m-O[22m, with the BSD personality.

       [1m-O [4m[22mformat[0m
              Like [1m-o[22m, but preloaded with some default columns.  Identical to [1m-o pid,[4m[22mformat[24m[1m,state,tname,time,command [22mor [1m-o pid,[4m[22mformat[24m[1m,tname,time,cmd[22m, see [1m-o [22mbelow.

       [1mo [4m[22mformat[0m
              Specify user-defined format.  Identical to [1m-o [22mand [1m--format[22m.

       [1m-o [4m[22mformat[0m
              User-defined  format.   [4mformat[24m  is  a  single argument in the form of a blank-separated or comma-separated list, which offers a way to specify individual output columns.  The
              recognized keywords are described in the [1mSTANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS [22msection below.  Headers may be renamed ([1mps -o pid,ruser=RealUser -o  comm=Command[22m)  as  desired.   If  all
              column  headers  are empty ([1mps -o pid= -o comm=[22m) then the header line will not be output.  Column width will increase as needed for wide headers; this may be used to widen up
              columns such as WCHAN ([1mps -o pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN -o comm[22m).  Explicit width control ([1mps opid,wchan:42,cmd[22m) is offered too.  The behavior of [1mps ‚Äêo  pid=X,comm=Y  [22mvaries
              with  personality; output may be one column named "X,comm=Y" or two columns named "X" and "Y".  Use multiple [1m-o [22moptions when in doubt.  Use the [1mPS_FORMAT [22menvironment variable
              to specify a default as desired; DefSysV and DefBSD are macros that may be used to choose the default UNIX or BSD columns.

       [1mZ      [22mAdd a column of security data.  Identical to [1m-M [22m(for SELinux).

[1mOUTPUT MODIFIERS[0m
       [1mc      [22mShow the true command name.  This is derived from the name of the executable file, rather than from the argv value.  Command arguments and any modifications to them are  thus
              not  shown.   This option effectively turns the [1margs [22mformat keyword into the [1mcomm [22mformat keyword; it is useful with the [1m-f [22mformat option and with the various BSD-style format
              options, which all normally display the command arguments.  See the [1m-f [22moption, the format keyword [1margs[22m, and the format keyword [1mcomm[22m.

       [1mh      [22mNo header.  (or, one header per screen in the BSD personality).  The [1mh [22moption is problematic.  Standard BSD [1mps [22muses this option to print a header on each page of output,  but
              older  Linux  [1mps  [22muses  this  option to totally disable the header.  This version of [1mps [22mfollows the Linux usage of not printing the header unless the BSD personality has been
              selected, in which case it prints a header on each page of output.  Regardless of the current personality, you can use the long options [1m--headers [22mand [1m--no-headers  [22mto  enable
              printing headers each page or disable headers entirely, respectively.

              Sorting order (overloaded).  The BSD [1mO [22moption can act like [1m-O [22m(user-defined output format with some  common  fields  predefined)  or  can  be  used  to  specify  sort  order.
              Heuristics  are  used to determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other way
              (e.g.  with [1m-O [22mor [1m--sort[22m).

              For sorting, obsolete BSD [1mO [22moption syntax is [1mO[22m[[1m+[22m|[1m-[22m][4mk1[24m[,[[1m+[22m|[1m-[22m][4mk2[24m[,...]].  It orders the processes listing according  to  the  multilevel  sort  specified  by  the  sequence  of

[1mNOTES[0m
       This [1mps [22mworks by reading the virtual files in /proc.  This [1mps [22mdoes not need to be setuid kmem or have any privileges to run.  Do not give this [1mps [22many special permissions.

       CPU  usage  is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent running during the entire lifetime of a process.  This is not ideal, and it does not conform to the standards that
       [1mps [22motherwise conforms to.  CPU usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.

       The SIZE and RSS fields don‚Äôt count some parts of a process including the page tables, kernel stack, struct thread_info, and struct task_struct.  This is usually at least 20 KiB  of
       memory that is always resident.  SIZE is the virtual size of the process (code+data+stack).

       Processes  marked  <defunct> are dead processes (so-called "zombies") that remain because their parent has not destroyed them properly.  These processes will be destroyed by [4minit[24m(8)
       if the parent process exits.

       If the length of the username is greater than the width of the display column, the username will be truncated.  See the [1m-o [22mand [1m-O [22mformatting options to customize length.

       Commands options such as [1mps -aux [22mare not recommended as it is a confusion of two different standards.  According to the POSIX and UNIX standards, the above command asks  to  display
       all  processes with a TTY (generally the commands users are running) plus all processes owned by a user named [4mx[24m.  If that user doesn‚Äôt exist, then [1mps [22mwill assume you really meant [1mps[0m
       [1maux[22m.

[1mPROCESS FLAGS[0m
       The sum of these values is displayed in the "F" column, which is provided by the [1mflags [22moutput specifier:

               1    forked but didn‚Äôt exec
               4    used super-user privileges

[1mPROCESS STATE CODES[0m
       Here are the different values that the [1ms[22m, [1mstat [22mand [1mstate [22moutput specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state of a process:

               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
               I    Idle kernel thread
               R    running or runnable (on run queue)
               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
               T    stopped by job control signal
               t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
               W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
               X    dead (should never be seen)
               Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

       For BSD formats and when the [1mstat [22mkeyword is used, additional characters may be displayed:

               <    high-priority (not nice to other users)
               N    low-priority (nice to other users)
               L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
               s    is a session leader
               l    is multi‚Äêthreaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
               +    is in the foreground process group

[1mOBSOLETE SORT KEYS[0m
       These keys are used by the BSD [1mO [22moption (when it is used for sorting).  The GNU [1m--sort [22moption doesn‚Äôt use these keys, but the specifiers  described  below  in  the  [1mSTANDARD  FORMAT[0m
       [1mSPECIFIERS  [22msection.  Note that the values used in sorting are the internal values [1mps [22muses and not the "cooked" values used in some of the output format fields (e.g.  sorting on tty
       will sort into device number, not according to the terminal name displayed).  Pipe [1mps [22moutput into the [1msort[22m(1) command if you want to sort the cooked values.

[1mSTANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS[0m
       Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the output format (e.g. with option [1m-o[22m) or to sort the selected processes with the GNU-style [1m--sort [22moption.

       For example: [1mps -eo pid,user,args --sort user[0m

       This version of [1mps [22mtries to recognize most of the keywords used in other implementations of [1mps[22m.

       The following user-defined format specifiers may contain spaces: [1margs[22m, [1mcmd[22m, [1mcomm[22m, [1mcommand[22m, [1mfname[22m, [1mucmd[22m, [1mucomm[22m, [1mlstart[22m, [1mbsdstart[22m, [1mstart[22m.

       Some keywords may not be available for sorting.

       [1mCODE        HEADER    DESCRIPTION[0m

       [1m%cpu        [22m%CPU      cpu utilization of the process in "##.#" format.  Currently, it is the CPU time used divided by the time the process has been running (cputime/realtime ratio),
                             expressed as a percentage.  It will not add up to 100% unless you are lucky.  (alias [1mpcpu[22m).

       [1m%mem        [22m%MEM      ratio of the process‚Äôs resident set size  to the physical memory on the machine, expressed as a percentage.  (alias [1mpmem[22m).

       [1mag_id       [22mAGID      The autogroup identifier associated with a process which operates in conjunction with the CFS scheduler to improve interactive desktop performance.

       [1mag_nice     [22mAGNI      The autogroup nice value which affects scheduling of all processes in that group.

       [1margs        [22mCOMMAND   command with all its arguments as a string. Modifications to the arguments may be shown.  The output in this column  may  contain  spaces.   A  process  marked
                             <defunct>  is  partly  dead,  waiting  to be fully destroyed by its parent.  Sometimes the process args will be unavailable; when this happens, [1mps [22mwill instead
                             print the executable name in brackets.  (alias [1mcmd[22m, [1mcommand[22m).  See also the [1mcomm [22mformat keyword, the [1m-f [22moption, and the [1mc [22moption.
                             When specified last, this column will extend to the edge of the display.  If [1mps [22mcan not determine display width, as when output is redirected  (piped)  into  a
                             file or another command, the output width is undefined (it may be 80, unlimited, determined by the [1mTERM [22mvariable, and so on).  The [1mCOLUMNS [22menvironment variable
                             or [1m--cols [22moption may be used to exactly determine the width in this case.  The [1mw [22mor [1m-w [22moption may be also be used to adjust width.

       [1mblocked     [22mBLOCKED   mask  of  the  blocked  signals,  see  [4msignal[24m(7).   According  to  the  width  of  the  field,  a 32 or 64-bit mask in hexadecimal format is displayed.  (alias
                             [1msig_block[22m, [1msigmask[22m).

       [1mbsdstart    [22mSTART     time the command started.  If the process was started less than 24 hours ago, the output format is " HH:MM", else it is "  Mmm:SS"  (where  Mmm  is  the  three
                             letters of the month).  See also [1mlstart[22m, [1mstart[22m, [1mstart_time[22m, and [1mstime[22m.

       [1mbsdtime     [22mTIME      accumulated  cpu time, user + system.  The display format is usually "MMM:SS", but can be shifted to the right if the process used more than 999 minutes of cpu
                             time.

       [1mc           [22mC         processor utilization. Currently, this is the integer value of the percent usage over the lifetime of the process.  (see [1m%cpu[22m).

       [1mcaught      [22mCAUGHT    mask of the caught signals, see [4msignal[24m(7).  According to the width of  the  field,  a  32  or  64  bits  mask  in  hexadecimal  format  is  displayed.   (alias
